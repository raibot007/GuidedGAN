# GuidedGAN

This is work in progress project.
The aim is to guide GAN to generate an image using grdual de-diffusion timesteps and the graidents from a noisy classifier trained on the base image dataset which are adulteratd from the same noise distribution, via multiple mini-GANs.

The motivation is to get a regulated control over Fidelity Vs Diversity tradeoff on the state of the art GANs and improve the FID and other such metrics, as achived by guided diffusion performed by https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion/

# Sampling from pre-trained models

To sample from these models, you can use the `classifier_sample.py`, `image_sample.py`, and `super_res_sample.py` scripts.
Here, we provide flags for sampling from all of these models.
We assume that you have downloaded the relevant model checkpoints into a folder called `models/`.

For these examples, we will generate 100 samples with batch size 4. Feel free to change these values.

```
SAMPLE_FLAGS="--batch_size 4 --num_samples 100 --timestep_respacing 250"
```

## Classifier guidance

Note for these sampling runs that you can set `--classifier_scale 0` to sample from the base diffusion model.
You may also use the `image_sample.py` script instead of `classifier_sample.py` in that case.

 * 64x64 model:

```
MODEL_FLAGS="--attention_resolutions 32,16,8 --class_cond True --diffusion_steps 1000 --dropout 0.1 --image_size 64 --learn_sigma True --noise_schedule cosine --num_channels 192 --num_head_channels 64 --num_res_blocks 3 --resblock_updown True --use_new_attention_order True --use_fp16 True --use_scale_shift_norm True"
python classifier_sample.py $MODEL_FLAGS --classifier_scale 1.0 --classifier_path models/64x64_classifier.pt --classifier_depth 4 --model_path models/64x64_diffusion.pt $SAMPLE_FLAGS
```
